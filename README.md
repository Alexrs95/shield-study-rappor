# shield-study-rappor

## Introduction
This addon is a SHIELD Study that collects the eTLD+1 of the user's homepage
and applies [RAPPOR](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/42852.pdf),
a [Differential Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy) algorithm, to encode it.
The result is sent in a custom ping.

The purpose of this study is to answer some questions with unbiased data such as:

- "Which top sites are users visiting?"
- "Which sites using Flash does a user encounter?"
- "Which sites does a user see heavy Jank on?" 

## Addon Behaviour
The addon collects the user's homepage from the `browser.startup.homepage` preference.
Then, from this value, obtains the eTLD+1. Here, it can fail if the host is 
an IP address or is empty when calling `Services.eTLD.getBaseDomain`. In such case, the
study ends.
Other possiblity is that the user's homepage is `about:home` or other `about:` page.
In the case of `about:home`, this is the value we use. In the case of other `about:`
page, the reported value is `about:pages`.

Once the user's homepage eTLD+1 value is obtained, RAPPOR is executed with the 
parameters chosen in [bug 1379195](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1379195).

The algorithm returns two values, the cohort and the encoded input value. This is sent
in a custom ping.

The cohort is stored in a preference if more than one value needs to be reported.

## Data format
This opt-out ping is sent from the addon when the homepage as been collected and 
RAPPOR has been executed.

## Development

### Install

`npm install`
`npm run build`

At second shell/prompt, watch files for changes to rebuild:

`npm run watch`


### In Firefox:

1. `about:debugging > [load temporary addon] > choose `dist/addon.xpi`
2. `tools > Web Developer > Browser Toolbox`


### Description of architecture

Restartless (`bootstrap.js`) extension.

During `bootstrap.js:startup(data, reason)`:

1. `shieldUtils` imports and sets configuration from `Config.jsm`
2. Modules are imported.
3. Study is setted up.
4. RAPPOR is executed.
4.  `boostrap.js` waits for requests from `HomepageStudy.jsm` the that 
are study related:  `["info", "telemetry", "endStudy"]`
5.  Data is sent to Telemetry.
7.  The study ends and the addon is uninstalled.
